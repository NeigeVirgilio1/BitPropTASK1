I personally recommend this code to be run in Flask and SQLAlchemy in Visual Studio.
I have commented all my thought processes and challenges within the code as it was easier to articulate myself while I was coding in real time.
I think the main issue for the code line that throws an exception is becuause my version of Visual Studio does not support it and I am unable to use an updated version as the laptop I have does not have the capacity for it.
Run the Application: Execute the Python script. The server will start, and you can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
